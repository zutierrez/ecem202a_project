# Project Proposal

## 1. Motivation & Objective

What are you trying to do and why? (plain English without jargon)

## 2. State of the Art & Its Limitations

How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

## 3. Novelty & Rationale

What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

## 4. Potential Impact

If the project is successful, what difference will it make, both technically and broadly?

## 5. Challenges

What are the challenges and risks?

## 6. Requirements for Success

Hardware bring-up and debugging skills are necessary to implement the onboard camera system. Furthermore, knowledge of deploying image classification models at the edge is necessary to succesfully implement the projects fundamental functionality. Lastly, resource required for this project include Edge Impulse for deploying DNNs, ArduCAM software documentation and resources for storing images in a cloud service (Microsoft Azure, AWS etc.)

## 7. Metrics of Success

The team will implement the system with the energy-efficient approach and without the energy-effecient approach. Without knowledge of overlapping FOV between a two-camera system, unnecessary power will be used for classifying and sending redundant images to the cloud service. We will compare power consumption of the system using the two approaches to demonstrate the success of the approach. 

## 8. Execution Plan

Describe the key tasks in executing your project, and in case of team project describe how will you partition the tasks.
