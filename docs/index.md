# Abstract

With recent advances in edge computing, networks of IoT devices have become more pervasive and as a result require more energy-efficient approaches for achieving tasks at the edge. Recent research aims to develop means for connecting various types of edge devices together in a collaborative network. To achieve better performance, novel methods must be developed to connect to remote servers in a fast and reliable manner. The objective of this project is to implement a dual camera edge device system which minimizes power consumption for running image classification models at the edge. In this project, the team implements energy-efficient approach which utilizes camera-to-camera communication via BLE to reduce power consumption by minimizing redundant images sent to a shared cloud service.
