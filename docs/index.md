# Energy-efficient cross-camera communication for overlapping FOV

# Abstract

With recent advances in edge computing, networks of IoT devices have become more pervasive and as a result require more energy-efficient approaches for achieving tasks at the edge. Recent research aims to develop means for connecting various types of edge devices together in collaborative networks. To achieve better performance, novel methods must be developed to connect to remote servers in a fast and reliable manner. The objective of this project is to implement a dual camera edge device system which minimizes power consumption for running image classification models at the edge. In this project, the team implements energy-efficient approach which utilizes camera-to-camera communication via BLE to reduce power consumption by minimizing redundant images sent to a shared cloud service. To achieve this objective, the team first implements a two-camera system with cross-camera communication via BLE. Second, the team deploys an image classification model which runs at the edge. Third, the team develops code for energy-efficient approach which minimizes redundant images sent to the cloud service computing overlapping field-of-view (FOV). Finally, the results of this project are measured by comparing power consumption of the system with energy-efficient communication and without it.
